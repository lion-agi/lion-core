## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lion-agi/lion-core.git
    cd lion-core
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .[dev]
    ```

4. Set up pre-commit hooks:
    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

5. Run tests:
    ```bash
    pytest --asyncio-mode=auto --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings tests/
    ```

6. Check code style:
    ```bash
    black --check .
    isort --check-only .
    ```

7. (Optional) Run pre-commit hooks manually:
    ```bash
    pre-commit run --all-files
    ```

Note: Pre-commit hooks will run automatically on `git commit`. If any checks fail, the commit will be aborted. Fix the issues and try committing again.
