    LionAGI Modifications:
        - Redesigned focusing on form-based task handling
        - fully integrated with LionAGI's existing collections and components
        - developed report system for multi-step task handling
        - created work system for task execution and management

    Base class for handling form-like structures within an application.
    Manages form components and operations such as filling forms and
    checking their state (filled, workable).

    Attributes:
        assignment (str): The objective of the form specifying input/output fields.
        input_fields (List[str]): Fields required to carry out the objective of the form.
        requested_fields (List[str]): Fields requested to be filled by the user.
        task (Any): The work to be done by the form, including custom instructions.
        validation_kwargs (Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]): Additional validation constraints for the form fields.
