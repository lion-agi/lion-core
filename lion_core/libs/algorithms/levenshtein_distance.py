def levenshtein_distance(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the Levenshtein distance between two strings.

    The Levenshtein distance is a measure of the difference between two sequences.
    It is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or
    substitutions) required to change one word into the other.

    Args:
        a (str): The first string to compare.
        b (str): The second string to compare.

    Returns:
        int: The Levenshtein distance between the two strings.

    Algorithm:
    1. Initialize a 2D array with dimensions (len(a)+1) x (len(b)+1).
    2. Populate the base case values for transforming prefixes.
    3. Use dynamic programming to compute the distance by considering
       insertions, deletions, and substitutions.
    4. Return the computed distance.
