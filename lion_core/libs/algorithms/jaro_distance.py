def jaro_distance(s, t):
    """
    Calculate the Jaro distance between two strings.

    The Jaro distance is a measure of similarity between two strings. The higher
    the Jaro distance for two strings is, the more similar the strings are. The
    value is between 0 and 1, with 1 meaning an exact match and 0 meaning no
    similarity.

    Args:
        s (str): The first string to compare.
        t (str): The second string to compare.

    Returns:
        float: The Jaro distance between the two strings.

    Algorithm:
    1. Calculate lengths of both strings. If both are empty, return 1.0.
    2. Determine the match distance as half the length of the longer string
       minus one.
    3. Initialize match flags for both strings.
    4. Identify matches within the match distance.
    5. Count transpositions.
    6. Compute and return the Jaro distance.

    The Jaro-Winkler similarity is an extension of the Jaro distance, adding a
