This module provides a function to filter elements in a nested structure
(dictionary or list) based on a given condition.

Functions:
- nfilter: Filter elements in a nested structure (dict or list) based on a
  condition.
- _filter_dict: Filter elements in a dictionary based on a condition.
- _filter_list: Filter elements in a list based on a condition.
