It all begins with element. 

an element is an observable part of a space. 

when element can be uniquely described, we then, can have different elements. 

By establishing the concept of difference, we have two natural inferences:
1. difference can come from a comparison of two, or
2. come from a change in state

Now we have the three core concepts

1. element      - a uniquely observable unit of information, also called an entity
2. ordering     - when elements differ by compare with others, the sequence of difference is an ordering
3. event        - when elements differ by a change in space, the change in state is called an event


then we have
1. operation, ordering of events
2. operator, an element carrying out the operation
3. condition, a place in certain space where an operation is performed,
4. container, a strucure containing elements
5. record, persistence of elements across change in space
6. operable, objects related to operation
7. index, information describing the ordering of elements in a container
8. relatable, entities can be described together in a meaningful way
9. sendable, an element that can be transferred among elements
